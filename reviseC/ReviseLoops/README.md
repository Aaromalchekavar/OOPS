### Question 2
Given a three digit identification number, the identification number
is said to be valid if sum of square of the digits is divisible by 10.
Given an identification number, develop an algorithm and write the C code
to print ‘Valid’ or ‘Invalid’. For example, 505, 608 are valid and number 444 is invalid.
<br />
<b>Input Format</b><br />
First line contains a three digit identification number<br />
<b>Output format</b>
