# TEST YOUR SKILLS
## Take-A-Test 1

### Question 1 -- Second Smallest Number
Given a set of n elements, write a program to find the second smallest number in that set.
[See the solution](ques1.cpp)

### Question 2 -- Euclids Algorithm
Find the GCD of two given numbers using euclids algorithm
[see the solution](ques2.c)

### Question 3 -- Self power or mth power
Given two number ‘n’ and ‘m’, write a C++ function to find Sum. Where Sum = 1m+2m+3m+...+nm, when m > 0 and Sum = 1^1+2^2+3^3+...+n^n when m = 0.

For example, when n = 5 and m = 3, Sum = 1^3+2^3+3^3+4^3+5^3 = 225 and when n = 5 and when m = 0, Sum = 1^1+2^2+3^3+4^4+5^5 = 3413.

**Boundary Conditions**

0≤n,m≤10

**Input Format**

First line of input contains an integer, n

Second line of input contains an integer, m

**Output Format**

Contains either the value of Sum if the given input satisfies the boundary conditions and ‘Invalid input’ otherwise.
