## Practise Expressions and conditional statements

### Question 1
A pharmaceutical company gives a 2% discount if the remaining balance is
paid within 10 days of purchase. Given the BillAmount, BuyingDay,
PayingDay of a customer, write an alogirthm and C program to print
the amount to be paid. Assume that the BuyingDay and PayingDay are
in the same month and year. For example, if the Billamount is 100.00,
BuyingDay is 12 and PayingDay is 20 then amount to be paid is 98.00.
Whereas when the Billamount is 100.00, BuyingDay is 12 and PayingDay is
23 then amount to be paid is 100.00. Print only two decimal places for the amount to be paid.
<br />
<b>Input Format</b> <br />
First line contains the BillAmount
<br />
Second line contains the BuyingDay
<br />
Third line contains the PayingDay

<b>Output Format</b> <br />

to print ‘Valid’ or ‘Invalid’. For example, 505, 608 are valid and number 444 is invalid.
<br />
