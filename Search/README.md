# Searching Algorithms
In computer science, a search algorithm is any algorithm which solves the Search problem, namely, to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain.

### Some commonly used searching algorithms
  1. [Linear Search](linear.c)<br />
<b>`Algorithm`</b>
```
STEP 1: Initialize the position variable as -1
STEP 2: Start from the leftmost element of array and one by one compare x with each element of array
STEP 3: If x matches with an element, store the value of index in position variable
STEP 3: If the final value of position variable is -1 => the element does not exist
```
